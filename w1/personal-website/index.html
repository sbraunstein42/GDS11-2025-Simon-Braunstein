        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Simon. </p> <br><br> 

        <p>I am a person who wears socks and sandals. My wife said she would never marry a person like that. But here we are. When I was a kid, I had blonde hair. Here's a picture of me when I was four or so: </p>

        <p>I lived in Taiwan for fourteen years, and speak terrible Chinese. These days I live in Cumberland. I have two kids, fourteen chickens, two cats, and I play too many video games. In fact, every year I go to Scotland to play video games with my friend David, but I really never go anywhere in Scotland, because I just hang out in my friend's basement and play/make games. It's hard to be as unhealthily addicted to video games when you have children, but I manage somehow! My wife is not pleased. Here is a picture of the chickens:</p>
