        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Simon. I have two kids, fourteen chickens, two cats, and 
        I play too many video games. Lately I play mostly Hollow Knight: Silksong and
        Valorant, but sometimes at work instead of eating lunch I will play Smash Ultimate.
        It's hard to be as unhealthily addicted to video games when you have children,
        but I manage somehow! My wife is not pleased.</p>
